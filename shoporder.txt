Indicates the type of work the operation represents. Possible values are:
Normal - Represents work originally planned for the shop order.
Non Routine - Represent additional work added to an already started shop order.
Rework - Represents additional work needed to address a problem detected with the work performed on a preceding operation.
"	"Op Block ID
The identifier of the operation block which to the operation is connected. This value is generated automatically when a new operation block is created and cannot be modified. The value consists of a prefix as defined in the Character and Numeric Value Default window with an incremental number.
"	"Work Center No
The short code of the work center.
"	"Work Center Description
The description of the work center.
"	"Work Center Code
Indicates whether this is an internal or external work center, as defined in Work Center.
"	"Preferred Resource
The resource which you wish to use to perform the operation. If an operation is started using a particular resource, the resource  will automatically be selected as the preferred resource. When you modify the preferred resource, if it is not equal to the scheduled resource, the operation will be rescheduled. (For CBS sites the value for the preferred resource will be Null).
"	"Scheduled Resource
The resource which is planned to be used for the operation.
"			"Operation  Quantity
The quantity to be completed by the operation. The value can differ from the lot size if split operations exist or operation scrap has been reported in previous operations. If the Adjust on Op Qty Deviation check box is selected, this value will also be adjusted when an operation is over/under reported.
"	"Mfg Factor
The manufacturing factor. This value, together with the factor unit, indicates the time required to use the machines or equipment for this operation. Updating this value does not change the routing operation that created this operation.
"	"Labor Setup Time
The setup time for the labor activity performed on this operation.
"	"Labor Factor
This value, together with the factor unit, indicates the time required for labor in this operation. Updating this value does not change the routing operation that created this operation.

"	"Remaining Qty
The remaining quantity to manufacture in the operation. You cannot update this column. The quantity is automatically reduced when you report the operation.
"	"Op Qty Deviation
Deviation between the actual completed and scrapped quantities relative to the planned operation quantity. A positive operation deviation is created when an operation is over reported. A negative operation deviation is created when an operation is closed with the quantity reported which is less than planned. This value affects the operation quantity of the succeeding operations and the remaining net supply of the shop order.
"	"Queue Time
The number of hours that this operation is scheduled to wait in queue before being processed. This value is used by the Shop Order Infinite Scheduler and also in lead time calculations. It is based on the work center calendar. This value is not taken into account if the operation is scheduled using Constraint Based Scheduling.
"		"Remaining Mfg Hours
The duration of the machine time remaining for the operation. You cannot update this value manually. It is reduced automatically when you report machine time or quantity on the operation. The Base Remaining Hours On setting on the connected work center controls how reported time and quantity will affect the calculation of the remaining time. 
If the factor unit of the operation is hours, it is reduced when the machine time is reported.
"	"Resource Share Per Unit
This indicates how big share per produced unit of the capacity of a work center resource the operation will utilize during its duration. The value entered must be higher than 0 and not higher than 1. If 0.1 is entered and the order quantity is 5 this means the operation will utilize 50% of the resource capacity during its duration. The cost and load of both machine setup and runtime of the operation is affected by this value.

A resource share per unit is normally used for operations where the runtime is not lot size dependent (Factor Unit = Hours).
"	"Resource Share
This indicates how big share of the capacity of a work center resource the operation will utilize during its duration.  The value entered must be higher than 0 and not higher than 1. If 0.5 is entered this means the operation will utilize 50% of the resource capacity during its duration. If a value for Resource Share per Unit has been entered this value is calculated as Resource Share per Unit * Quantity and cannot be manually updated. The cost and load of both machine setup and runtime of the operation is affected by this value.


"	"Remaining Resource Hours
The sum of machine setup and runtime considering the resource share remaining for the operation. Calculated as: Remaining Machine Time * Resource Share.
"	"Setup Labor Class No

"	"Labor Class
The labor class to which the labor operation belongs.
"	"Crew Size
The crew size of the operation. This information is retrieved from the operation list that you entered when you created the routing for the ordered part in the Routing page. If you change this value, only the specified shop order will be affected.
"	"Setup Crew Size
The number of people required to set up the operation. A value in this field is optional unless the labor setup time is greater than zero.
"	"Emp Setup Qual Profile

The qualification profile that an employee should have, in order to be able to perform the operation in shop floor workbench.
"	"Qual  Profile Name
The name of the qualification profile.
"	"Remaining Labor Hours
The time remaining for the labor operation. You cannot update this value manually. It is reduced automatically when you report labor time or quantity on the operation. The Base Remaining Hours On setting on the connected work center controls how reported time and quantity will affect the calculation of remaining time.
 If the factor unit of the operation is hours, it is reduced when the labor time is reported.
"	"Remaining Man Hours
Remaining labor time in man hours. Calculated as;
(Remaining Labor Time x Planned Crew Size on the operation)
"	"Runtime Assigned
If selected, it indicates that there are employees assigned to perform the operation. The assigned employees are only suggestions and therefore it is possible for other employees to perform the work.
"	"Transport Time
The time it takes to transport material from this operation. This field is required, and the default value is 0 (zero). The value for transport time must be 0 or greater. The shop order loader schedules transport time using the site manufacturing calendar. When using CBS, this time is scheduled based on the site transport calendar or a 24 hour calendar.
"	"Factor Unit
Designates how machine factor and labor factor are used.Possible values are:

Hours/Unit - How many hours it takes to manufacture a unit. 
Units/Hour - How many units can be manufactured in an hour. 
Hours - How many hours the manufacturing process takes, regardless of the number of units.



"	"Parallel Operation
Indicates whether the operation can be scheduled at the same time as the preceding non-parallel operation. Possible values are Parallel and Not Parallel.
"	"Efficiency Factor
The operation efficiency affects only the runtime, not the setup time. When operation efficiency is set to less than 100%, the runtime of machine and labor of shop order operation increases. This results in an increased value for remaining manufacturing hours that could affect the scheduled start and/or finish dates of the operation. The standard cost of the operation also gets affected when operation efficiency changes. Operation efficiency of running operations can be changed to incorporate any performance changes into operation runtime, remaining manufacturing hours and for scheduling 

"	"Overlap
The overlap between the current routing operation (operation 2) and the previous routing operation (operation 1). The overlap represents the earliest point in routing operation 1, when the start of routing operation 2 can be scheduled. The overlap will be expressed either in units (number of units completed) or as a percentage (of the time it takes to perform the previous operation for the quantity due), based on the value in the Overlap Unit field. 
"	"Overlap Unit
Specify whether the overlap between the current routing operation and the previous routing operation is expressed in units or as a percentage of the time to complete the previous operation for the quantity due. The overlap represents the point in the previous routing operation when the start of the current routing operation can be scheduled. Possible values are: Units or Percent.
"	"Include Setup Time in  Overlap
Overlap represents the earliest point of a routing operation at which the start of a subsequent routing operation can be scheduled. If the check box is selected and the subsequent operation has a setup time, both setup and run time will be used in the overlap calculation. As a result, the setup time for the subsequent operation will be scheduled after the overlap time. If the check box is cleared, then only the run time of the subsequent operation will be used for the overlap calculation. As a result, the setup time of the subsequent operation can be scheduled before the operation overlap time.
"	"Schedule Direction
The scheduling direction of the shop order operation. When a shop order is scheduled the scheduling direction of the operations will be set according to the scheduling direction of the shop order. However you may manually change the scheduling direction of an operation to any of the below values:

Backwards Scheduling - The operation and operations preceding the operation are backward scheduled from its finish date.
Forward Scheduling - The operation and operations succeeding the operation are forward scheduled from its start date.
Manual Scheduling - The operation is scheduled by manually defining its start and finish dates.
"	"Start Date
The date and time when the operation will start.
"	"Finish Date
The date on which each operation is scheduled to be finished.
"	"Outside Op Item

"	"Send To Next  Supplier
If this check box is selected, it indicates that the outside operation item should be directly sent from the supplier of the operation to the supplier of the succeeding operation, if the succeeding operation is also an outside operation. When this check box is selected for an outside operation having a succeeding outside operation, the delivery address of the purchase order line will be automatically updated from the company delivery address to the address of the supplier of the next operation. It has no effect when the next operation is an internal operation.
"	"Outside Op Complete
A check box indicating if the outside processing or subcontracting operation associated with the operation is complete.
"	"Schedule Capacity
The type of capacity used to schedule the shop order. Possible values are Infinite capacity and Finite capacity.
"	"CBS Queue Time
If the operation is scheduled by CBS, this is the number of hours that it needs to wait in queue before it is scheduled to start. This is calculated each time the operation is rescheduled. If the operation is CBS unscheduled, there will be no CBS queue time. This value is calculated as follows.

For the first operation:
If backward scheduled: Operation start time - Latest possible start time (LPST) of the shop order
If forward scheduled: Operation start time - Earliest possible start time (EPST) of the shop order

Other operations:
Operation start time - End time of previous operation - Transport time of previous operation

"	"Milestone Operation
If this check box is selected, it indicates that the operation is a milestone operation and it is not possible to report a larger quantity on succeeding operations than the quantity reported on the milestone operation.  Automatic reporting of milestone operations is not allowed, and therefore automatic  reporting at receipt is not allowed unless all milestone operations have been reported.
Note: It is possible to cancel operation reporting of a milestone operation, even if succeeding operations are reported.
"	"Increase Lot Size On Scrap
If this check box is selected, when you report scrap on the operation, if the total operation scrap reported on the shop order exceeds the planned scrap, then the shop order lot size will be increased to compensate for the excessive scrap reported.
